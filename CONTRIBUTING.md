## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python3 hud_notes.py
   ```

3. **Test the installation scripts (optional):**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

### Development Dependencies

For development work, you may want to install additional tools:

```bash
# Code formatting
pip3 install black

# Linting
pip3 install flake8

# Testing
pip3 install pytest
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and relatively small
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Code Formatting

We recommend using `black` for code formatting:

```bash
black hud_notes.py
```

### Documentation

- Update docstrings when modifying functions
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Comment complex logic clearly
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## Template Development

### Creating New Templates

Templates are stored in the `templates/` directory and use Markdown format with Python string formatting.

#### Template Variables

Available variables:
- `{title}` - Note title
- `{author}` - Author name  
- `{date}` - Current date and time

#### Template Guidelines

1. **File naming:** Use snake_case with `.md` extension
2. **Content structure:** Include clear sections and helpful prompts
3. **Formatting:** Use consistent Markdown formatting
4. **Variables:** Always include `{title}`, `{author}`, and `{date}`
5. **Documentation:** Add comments explaining the template's purpose

#### Example Template

```markdown
# {title}

**Author:** {author}
**Date:** {date}
**Category:** Your Category Here

---

## Section 1

Content and prompts here...

## Section 2

More content...

---
**Tags:** #tag1 #tag2 #{category}
```

### Template Testing

Test your templates by:

1. Adding the template file to `templates/`
2. Restarting HUD Notes
3. Creating a new note with your template
4. Verifying all variables are properly substituted
5. Checking the formatting and usability
